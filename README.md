# ORMIR-XCT

ORMIR_XCT is an open-source Python package that provides workflows for processing High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) scans. Development of the ORMIR_XCT package began at the first Open and Reproducible Musculoskeletal Imaging Research (ORMIR) community workshop in Maastricht, The Netherlands in 2022. The goal of the ORMIR_XCT package is to reimplement existing workflows and develop new image processing workflows for HR-pQCT scans.
